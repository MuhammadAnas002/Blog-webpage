        <p>The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word
            cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[4] The Late Latin word may be derived from
            an unidentified African language.[5] The Nubian word kaddîska wildcat and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources
            or cognates.[6]</p>

        <p> The forms might also have derived from an ancient Germanic word that was absorbed into Latin and then into
            Greek, Syriac, and Arabic.[7] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and
            ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sámi gáđfi, female stoat, and Hungarian hölgy, lady, female
            stoat; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, female (of a furred animal).[8]</p>

        <p> The English puss, extended as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may have been
            introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte, related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus,
            pusekatt. Similar forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The etymology is unknown, but
            it may be an onomatopoeia from using a sound to attract a cat.[9][10]</p>

        <p> A male cat is called a tom or tomcat[11] (or a gib,[12] if neutered). A female is called a queen.[13] Some
            sources wrote that queen refers to unspayed cats that are in an estrous cycle.[14] (or sometimes a
            molly,[15] if spayed). A juvenile cat is referred to as a kitten. In Early Modern English, that was
            interchangeable with the now-obsolete word catling.[16] A group of cats can be referred to as a clowder, a
            glaring,[17] or a colony.</p>
